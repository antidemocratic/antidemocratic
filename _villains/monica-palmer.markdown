title:  "Monica Palmer"
---
Member of the Wayne Count Board of Canvassers during the 2020 Election. Refused to certify the election results from Wayne county, citing fraud without evidence. Offered to certify communities other than Detroit, thus threatening to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Black voters. Eventually changed her mind and certified the results. Then changed her mind again after a call from President Trump, and attempted to [withdraw her certification](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2020/11/19/trump-monica-palmer-wayne-canvassers-certification-election/3776190001/).
